-- Gets percentage of total force merges, force merges with failures, and force merges without failures (impatient)
-- Specifically this query tracks the force merges kpi and metric on HUD
--
-- Special params:
--   one_bucket: If set to false, bucketizes the results over the requested granularity
--               otherwise there is not bucketing
--   merge_type: If set, will return only data about the requested force merge type.
--               Can be one of: "All", "Impatience", "Failures", or " " (to get everything)
